# Contributing to PatchLens

_Thanks for your interest in PatchLens!_ This document explains the legal terms that apply to any contribution you propose to the PatchLens project. Please read it before opening an issue or pull request (PR).

“PatchLens” refers to the project and any of its components or repositories maintained by the PatchLens maintainers (“we,” “us”). “You” means the individual or entity offering a contribution or feedback. “Affiliate” means any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party.

> **Important:** This document focuses on legal/rights aspects of contributing. It is not legal advice.

---

## 1) Project License and Relicensing

- **Current open-source license:** Unless a repository states otherwise in its `LICENSE`, PatchLens source code is licensed under **AGPL-3.0-only** (the “Project License”).
- **Relicensing:** We may, at our discretion, release future versions or components of PatchLens under different terms (for example, GPL, MIT, or proprietary/commercial terms). Past releases remain under their original licenses.
- **Dual licensing:** We may offer commercial licenses for organizations that prefer non-AGPL terms. This does not affect your rights under the open-source license.

---

## 2) What “Contribution” Covers

- **Code and content:** Any code, tests, documentation, translations, or similar material submitted for inclusion in a PatchLens repository (typically via a PR).
- **Feedback:** Ideas, proposals, bug reports, feature requests, comments, and other material submitted in issues, discussions, or similar channels.

---

## 3) Feedback Terms (Issues & Discussions)

To keep issues and discussions low-friction, no separate click-through is required. **By submitting Feedback, you agree** that:

1. **License to Use Feedback.** You grant us a **perpetual, irrevocable**, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, adapt, publish, create derivative works from, and distribute your Feedback for any purpose, including improving PatchLens and related materials or services.

2. **No Confidential Information.** Do not submit confidential or proprietary information. You agree your Feedback is non-confidential and may be publicly visible.

3. **Rights and Originality.** You have the right to provide the Feedback and it does not knowingly infringe third-party rights.

4. **No Compensation.** You agree that Feedback is provided voluntarily with no expectation of compensation, attribution beyond standard project norms, or obligation for us to use or respond to it.

These terms let you open issues freely while ensuring we can act on your suggestions without additional paperwork.

## 4) Contribution Terms (Pull Requests)

Because PRs change the codebase or documentation, we require an explicit affirmation in the PR to ensure clear rights for project governance and future licensing.

### 4.1 Contributor License Grant (CLG)

For any **Contribution** submitted via PR and intended for inclusion in PatchLens, you grant us:

- **Copyright License.** A **perpetual, irrevocable**, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Contributions, **and to relicense your Contributions under any terms, including proprietary or commercial licenses**.

- **Patent License.** A **perpetual, irrevocable**, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free license under patent claims you own or control that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination with PatchLens, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer PatchLens incorporating the Contribution.  
  **Patent Retaliation:** This patent license terminates if you or your Affiliate initiate patent litigation alleging that PatchLens or any incorporated Contribution infringes a patent.

- **Moral Rights / Similar.** To the maximum extent permitted by law, you waive (or agree not to assert) moral rights or similar rights in your Contributions as needed to exercise the above licenses.

Unless we state otherwise, we will generally make Contributions available to the public under the Project License current for the relevant repository at release time.

### 4.2 Your Representations (PRs)

By submitting a PR, you represent and warrant that:

- **Originality / Rights.** You are the sole author and owner of the Contribution, or you have the necessary rights and authority to grant the above licenses on behalf of the owner.
- **No Conflicts.** The Contribution does not, to your knowledge, violate any third-party rights (including IP, confidentiality, or contractual obligations).
- **Third-Party Material.** You will not include third-party code or content that is incompatible with the Project License or would restrict our ability to relicense as described above. If referencing third-party material, clearly identify it and its license.
- **No Sensitive Data.** The Contribution contains no confidential or personal data.
- **Corporate Authority.** If contributing on behalf of an employer or other entity, you are authorized to bind that entity to these terms.

### 4.3 Required PR Affirmation

To avoid ambiguity, we require explicit assent for PRs:

- **Maintainer prompt.** For any external PR, a maintainer will link to this `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Affirmation.** The PR author must **state in a top-level PR comment** that they have read and **agree** to the terms in this document. Without this affirmation, we may decline or refrain from reviewing or merging the PR.

---

## 5) Inbound = Outbound (Clarity)

Unless otherwise specified, your merged Contribution will be made available to the public under the **current Project License** for the repository (AGPL-3.0-only at this time).  
**Additionally**, under the CLG above, you grant us the right to **relicense** your Contribution (e.g., in future GPL/MIT releases or commercial editions), so the project can evolve licensing consistently without re-contacting past contributors.

---

## 6) Acceptance, Use, and Direction

We may accept, modify, request changes to, or decline Contributions at our discretion for legal, security, quality, scope, or project-direction reasons. We may ask you to confirm provenance or remove problematic third-party material.

---

## 7) Trademarks and Branding

This document grants **no rights** to use the PatchLens name, logos, or other brand assets. Use of our marks is governed by our trademark policy (if published) and applicable law. Do not imply endorsement or affiliation without written permission.

---

## 8) Privacy and Publicity

Participation in project channels (issues, PRs, discussions) may make some information public (e.g., your username or organization). Please avoid sharing private or sensitive information.

---

## 9) Questions and Commercial Licensing

If you have questions about these terms, or if your organization needs non-AGPL terms for PatchLens components, please contact the maintainers about commercial licensing options.

---

## 10) Changes to This Document

We may update this `CONTRIBUTING.md` to clarify terms or reflect policy changes. The version linked in a PR at the time of your affirmation governs that Contribution. The then-current version applies to Feedback submitted after it is published.

---

_By submitting a pull request and affirming your agreement in a PR comment, you accept the Contribution Terms above. By submitting Feedback in issues or discussions, you accept the Feedback Terms above._
